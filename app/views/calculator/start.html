          You can use this calculator to work out an amount of child maintenance for your children.
          It will not send your details to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

              <li>shows you what the government is likely to work out for you</li>

              This calculation will only be an estimate - it will not be a guarantee of your child maintenance payments.

              In the Child Maintenance Service application you may be asked more questions, which can make the total payments higher or lower.

    <p>This is when a paying parent’s child stays overnight with them.</p>

    <p>We call it ‘shared care’ if a child stays overnight with the paying parent.
       If shared care happens for an average of one night a week or more (at least 52 nights a year), this can affect 
       child maintenance payments. If the day-to-day care of a child is equal between the paying and the receiving parent, 
       neither parent pays any child maintenance to the other parent</p>
